				<p><b>Description:</b> For almost ten years I have been accompanying my father to work and train in the electrical field. My father taught me to have a great work ethic, in which the idea is always to do one's best with whatever one can be faced with. This involved training on sites that were both commercial and residential jobs, the most recent being an <i>Anytime Fitness</i> in which I was the lead journeyman on the job.</p>
