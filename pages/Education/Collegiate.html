			<h1>College Education</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Past College Education: University of Illinois at Champaign/Urbana</h2>
					<p><b>Major Requested:</b> Electrical and Computer Engineering<br><br><b>Description:</b> The University of Illinois was an amazing campus to attend school at, in which I developed a great deal of experience in my life while attending there as well as formed many meaningful relationships. In fact, while going to school at the University of Illinois, I had the privelege of being both a lab instructor and teacher's assistant. I enjoyed teaching and learning at the University of Illinois, especially since it helped attribute to who I am to this day, in which it was an experience I would not forget.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Current Attending College: DeVry University at Tinley Park</h2>
					<p><b>Major:</b> Computer Information Systems<br><b>Specialization:</b> Web Game Programming<br><b>Current GPA:</b> 4.0<br><b>Projected Graduation Date:</b> May, 2018<br><br><b>Description:</b> One of the areas that was a huge important thing to me was being able to get out into the workforce quickly with something I was passionate about. I realized after attending the University of Illinois that my passion for Electrical Engineering was not as strong as it was for a background in programming. DeVry offered the possibility of being able to complete an education at the pace I wanted and has always given me the chance of furthering myself in any way possible. I take over twenty credit hours a semester to challenge myself and move quickly through a programming degree based on the idea of knowing it is a field I am quite passionate about. In all, I should have a bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems in just two years of going to school. From there I hope to become an exceptional web designer or game developer!</p>
